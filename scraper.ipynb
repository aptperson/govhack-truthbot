It is spent by the states. Changes to the GST are absolutely a matter for the states and territories.\\\"\\n\\nA day earlier, in response to a question about removing the GST from sanitary items on ABC's Q&A, then treasurer Joe Hockey said: \\\"I'd need the agreement of the states ... I will give you this undertaking: I will raise it with the states at the next meeting of the treasurers in July.\\\"\\n\\nFact Check examined the GST Act 1999, as well as the agreement made with the states in 1998, and consulted experts to determine whether the assent of the states is required to change the GST.\\n\\nIndeed, the Act states: \\\"The Parliament acknowledges that the Commonwealth will maintain the rate and base of the GST in accordance with the Agreement on Principles for the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations endorsed at the Special Premiers' Conference in Canberra on 13 November 1998.\\\"\\n\\nAnd part 3 of the agreement concurs:\\n\\nSubject to clauses 34, 35 and 36 of this Agreement, after the introduction of the GST, any proposal to vary the GST base will require:\\nthe unanimous support of the State and Territory Governments;\\nthe endorsement by the Commonwealth Government of the day; and\\nthe passage of relevant legislation by both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, published expert legal opinion found that despite the provisions in the agreement, the agreement is judicially unenforceable.\\n\\n\\\"The GST intergovernmental agreement is, we think, a prime example of the kind of political compact enforceable (so to speak) only by political sanctions ultimately at the hands of the electors. It follows that it is not truly legally i.e. judicially enforceable at all: for a court to venture on that course would be, as Sir Owen Dixon put it, to extend the court's 'true function into a domain that does not belong to it',\\\" a legal opinion commissioned by the Australian newspaper from Bret Walker SC and A.D Lang said.\\n\\nhockeyabbott\\n\\nLegal academics Fact Check spoke said that legislation could not be used to bind a future parliament.\\n\\nAnne Twomey, from the University of Sydney Law School said: \\\"The GST legislation can be amended at any time by the Commonwealth Parliament by ordinary majorities in each house. Although it says that the states must agree to changes in the rate and base of the GST, this can simply be amended or repealed by ordinary Commonwealth legislation.\\\"\\n\\nAnd George Williams from UNSW told Fact Check: \\\"The Act requires their consent, but there's nothing to stop Parliament changing the act to remove that requirement. It's a self-imposed requirement that can be easily disposed of by way of an amendment. There is no doubt that federal Parliament can therefore make the change unilaterally if it desires to do so.\\\"\\n\\nUltimately, Fact Check found that the only factor truly preventing the Government from removing the GST on tampons was a potential political backlash, not a legal roadblock, and that if Mr Abbott meant that a government may not attempt to change the GST without the support of the states and territories because it would be politically difficult, he should have said so.\\n\\nSo Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey's claims about changing the GST were misleading, just as Mr Shorten's is today.\",\n",

It is spent by the states. Changes to the GST are absolutely a matter for the states and territories.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nA day earlier, in response to a question about removing the GST from sanitary items on ABC\\'s Q&A, then treasurer Joe Hockey said: \\\\\"I\\'d need the agreement of the states ... I will give you this undertaking: I will raise it with the states at the next meeting of the treasurers in July.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFact Check examined the GST Act 1999, as well as the agreement made with the states in 1998, and consulted experts to determine whether the assent of the states is required to change the GST.\\\\n\\\\nIndeed, the Act states: \\\\\"The Parliament acknowledges that the Commonwealth will maintain the rate and base of the GST in accordance with the Agreement on Principles for the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations endorsed at the Special Premiers\\' Conference in Canberra on 13 November 1998.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAnd part 3 of the agreement concurs:\\\\n\\\\nSubject to clauses 34, 35 and 36 of this Agreement, after the introduction of the GST, any proposal to vary the GST base will require:\\\\nthe unanimous support of the State and Territory Governments;\\\\nthe endorsement by the Commonwealth Government of the day; and\\\\nthe passage of relevant legislation by both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHowever, published expert legal opinion found that despite the provisions in the agreement, the agreement is judicially unenforceable.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The GST intergovernmental agreement is, we think, a prime example of the kind of political compact enforceable (so to speak) only by political sanctions ultimately at the hands of the electors. It follows that it is not truly legally i.e. judicially enforceable at all: for a court to venture on that course would be, as Sir Owen Dixon put it, to extend the court\\'s \\'true function into a domain that does not belong to it\\',\\\\\" a legal opinion commissioned by the Australian newspaper from Bret Walker SC and A.D Lang said.\\\\n\\\\nhockeyabbott\\\\n\\\\nLegal academics Fact Check spoke said that legislation could not be used to bind a future parliament.\\\\n\\\\nAnne Twomey, from the University of Sydney Law School said: \\\\\"The GST legislation can be amended at any time by the Commonwealth Parliament by ordinary majorities in each house. Although it says that the states must agree to changes in the rate and base of the GST, this can simply be amended or repealed by ordinary Commonwealth legislation.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAnd George Williams from UNSW told Fact Check: \\\\\"The Act requires their consent, but there\\'s nothing to stop Parliament changing the act to remove that requirement. It\\'s a self-imposed requirement that can be easily disposed of by way of an amendment. There is no doubt that federal Parliament can therefore make the change unilaterally if it desires to do so.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, Fact Check found that the only factor truly preventing the Government from removing the GST on tampons was a potential political backlash, not a legal roadblock, and that if Mr Abbott meant that a government may not attempt to change the GST without the support of the states and territories because it would be politically difficult, he should have said so.\\\\n\\\\nSo Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey\\'s claims about changing the GST were misleading, just as Mr Shorten\\'s is today.\",\\n  \"text\" : \"<p>Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has confirmed that Labor will not be scrapping the GST on tampons if elected, despite <a href=\\\\\"https://www.communityrun.org/petitions/stop-taxing-my-period\\\\\" target=\\\\\"_self\\\\\" title=\\\\\"\\\\\">a concerted campaign from the public to do so</a> — a backflip from <a href=\\\\\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%!A(MISSING)%!c(MISSING)hamber%!F(MISSING)hansardr%!F(MISSING)5005d996-a229-4d88-a18a-97e4c70215a3%!F(MISSING)0054%!\\\\(MISSING)\" target=\\\\\"_self\\\\\" title=\\\\\"\\\\\">a previous position.</a></p><p> </p><p>\\\\\"In terms of the GST on tampons, in an ideal world we would scrap that.
