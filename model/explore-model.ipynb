      "If you think the party that has presided over the most sustained fall in our living standards since records began… then the Liberal Party is the party for you. – Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen, Treasurers' Debate, May 27, 2016.\n",
      "During the Treasurers' debate with federal treasurer Scott Morrison at the National Press Club, Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen said that the Liberal Party had presided over the most sustained fall in Australian living standards since records began.\n",
      "Bowen has made similar claims in the past.\n",
      "Is he right?\n",
      "It depends a bit on which dataset you’re looking at.\n",
      "Checking the source\n",
      "When asked for a source to support his assertion, a spokesman for Bowen supplied a spreadsheet downloaded from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Australian National Accounts: National Income, Expenditure and Product data set. He highlighted this column:\n",
      "ABS Australian National Accounts: National Income, Expenditure and Product to Dec 2015, Column AS.\n",
      "The spokesman said:\n",
      "Living standards (as measured by “real net national disposable income per capita” or more generally referred to as “income per person”) have now fallen for seven consecutive quarters – the first time this has happened since records began.\n",
      "Is the claim accurate?\n",
      "It is true that real net national disposable income per capita fell for seven quarters between June 2014 and December 2015 inclusive, using the seasonally adjusted series. That was the latest data available when Bowen made the comment.\n",
      "In fact, the latest data (released after Bowen made the claim) shows that real net national disposable income per capita has now fallen for eight consecutive quarters – between June 2014 and March 2016. The chart below shows how it changed between Dec 2007 and March 2016:\n",
      "The ABS started publishing data on household income per capita in the December quarter of 1973. There were two quarters of negative growth starting in December 1981 and four quarters of negative real growth from September 1982 to June 1983, inclusive. These falls were interrupted by one quarter of growth in the June 1982 quarter.\n",
      "The same pattern recurred between June 1989 and June 1991 – two quarters of real falls, one quarter of growth, and then another four quarters of falling living standards.\n",
      "There were also real falls in living standards for four quarters at the time of the global financial crisis in 2008-09.\n",
      "Overall, using this particular measure of household living standards, the shadow treasurer was correct. The period since the June quarter of 2014 has seen the longest uninterrupted period of falls in real household disposable income per capita, on a seasonally adjusted basis.\n",
      "Other long periods of sustained falls in living standards\n",
      "Chris Bowen’s statement is right if you use the seasonally adjusted numbers – meaning the data that is smoothed out to minimise the effect of seasonal factors such as Christmas.\n",
      "The ABS also publishes trend data on real net national disposable income per capita. This statistical technique smooths out the data even further to remove the effect of outliers; it’s more signal than noise.\n",
      "In the explanatory notes to the National Accounts, the ABS says that\n",
      "Given the qualifications regarding the accuracy and reliability of the quarterly national accounts, the ABS considers that trend estimates provide the best guide to the underlying movements, and are more suitable than either the seasonally adjusted or original data for most business decisions and policy advice. [emphasis added]\n",
      "Looking at the trend series – rather than the seasonally adjusted figures used in the response by Bowen’s spokesman – gives a slightly different picture of different periods.\n",
      "On these numbers, in addition to the seven quarters of real income falls between June 2014 and Dec 2015 (the latest data available when Bowen made the claim), there were seven quarters of falling living standards between December 1981 and June 1983, and again between December 1989 and June 1991, inclusive.\n",
      "Some of those periods happened when Labor was in power.\n",
      "Living standards have not risen since December 2011\n",
      "The trend series also shows that real household living standards have not risen since the December quarter of 2011 – that is 17 quarters ago. This is an unprecedentedly long period in which real living standards have not risen – one that started when Labor was in government, but has not been reversed since the change of government in 2013.\n",
      "Cumulatively this amounts to a 6.1% reduction in real household disposable income per capita since December 2011. That is slightly greater than the 6.0% real fall in 2008-09 and approaches the 6.4% real fall in the 1990s recession. However, it is still less than the 7.5% real fall in the recession of the early 1980s.\n",
      "Is this the only way to measure living standards?\n",
      "There are a range of alternative measures of living standards that could be considered. Gross Domestic Product per capita, for example, has not fallen in real terms since the March quarter of 2009.\n",
      "However, GDP per capita is widely recognised as an inadequate measure of household well being. Indeed, in the 2013 results for Measuring Australia’s Progress, the ABS said that\n",
      "Real net national disposable income per capita is considered a good measure of progress for enhancing living standards, because it is an indicator of Australians' capacity to consume goods and services.\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "Chris Bowen’s statement was accurate – but it also didn’t tell the whole story.\n",
      "Looking solely at the “real net national disposable income per capita” figures for Australia, which were the source of Bowen’s claim about a sustained fall in living standards, the shadow treasurer was correct. The period since the June quarter of 2014 has seen the longest uninterrupted period of falls in real household disposable income per capita, on a seasonally adjusted basis.\n",
      "But according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the trend estimates on real net national disposable income per capita provide the best guide on shifts in Australian society and its economy.\n",
      "That trend estimates data reveal that real household living standards in Australia have not risen since the December quarter of 2011, or 17 quarters ago. It’s an unprecedentedly long period in which real living standards have not risen – which began when Labor was in government and which has not been reversed since the Coalition took power in 2013. – Peter Whiteford.\n",
      "Review\n",
      "There are many potential ways to measure living standards, but the national accounts provide the longest-running and most consistent measures. Real net national disposable income per capita is the ABS preferred measure of average living standards, and it is the seasonally adjusted series of this measure that the shadow treasurer has relied on.\n",
      "This series has now declined for eight successive quarters, which is the longest sustained decline since September 1959 (the earliest quarter for which the measure can be calculated). If we instead examine the trend series, the current period of decline extends to 17 successive quarters.\n",
      "Net national disposable income per capita is not, however, a measure of household disposable income per capita. To measure household incomes using the national accounts, one must draw on the household income account (Table 20 in the quarterly national accounts published by the ABS).\n",
      "The figure below shows quarterly percentage changes in seasonally adjusted real household disposable income per capita. This provides a measure of how average household incomes have changed, which I would argue is a better measure of changes in the living standards of Australian households.\n",
      "Household disposable income per capita\n",
      "It shows that average household incomes have declined in only four of the last eight quarters. So, tested against this particular data set, the shadow treasurer’s statement would be incorrect.\n",
      "What’s driving the difference between net national disposable income and household disposable income? In part, it is rising government debt, which is acting to support living standards of households despite falling net national disposable income. National income is declining but household income is not declining quite so much because the government is going into debt. (In the most recent quarters, an increase in corporate debt also helps to explain the gap.)\n",
      "A further caveat is that the national accounts tell us nothing about the distribution of income. For example, if incomes of the rich have been growing strongly in recent years, the median household is likely to have experienced a decline in real income.\n",
      "Household income surveys are the preferred source for questions of distribution, but these are less regular (especially prior to 1994). They are also less consistent than the national accounts in methods and measures across years. – Roger Wilkins\n",

      "Both the Coalition and the ALP have committed to raising tobacco excise by 12.5% a year for four years, starting on September 1, 2017. However, both sides have produced vastly different estimates of the revenue gain over the next decade.\n",
      "Ads authorised by the Liberal Party claim that the ALP faces a $19.5 billion “black hole” arising from the differences in the costings between the two parties.\n",
      "Is that assertion correct?\n",
      "What are the major parties proposing for tobacco tax?\n",
      "The federal government imposes a tobacco excise on locally produced and imported tobacco products, raising an estimated $10.2 billion in 2016-17.\n",
      "The ALP’s tobacco policy, released in November 2015, outlines a plan to increase the tobacco excise by 12.5% a year, each year, from September 2017 until September 2020. The ALP says that\n",
      "The policy has been independently costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office to raise $3.8 billion over the current forward estimate period and $47.7 billion over the medium term.\n",
      "In his 2016-17 budget speech on May 3, federal Treasurer Scott Morrison announced that the Coalition would also\n",
      "implement a further four annual 12.5% increases in tobacco excise, with the first increase to take effect on 1 September 2017.\n",
      "In the 2016-17 Budget Paper 2, on page 16, the Coalition government states that the increases in tobacco excise would raise $4.7 billion over the four years of the forward estimates – from 2016-17 to 2019-20.\n",
      "However, we have no published figure in the budget papers for the government’s 10-year costing of the tobacco excise hike. Instead, news reports quoting the Treasury’s 10-year costings refer to a separate leaked Treasury document, circulated prior to the release of the budget, that reported its forecasts for the government.\n",
      "Under both Coalition and ALP policy, the tobacco excise rate is expected to rise from around $0.54 per cigarette this year to about $1.10 per cigarette in 2020, as shown in the chart below. This includes continued indexation of the tobacco excise rate to wages.\n",
      "Why are there two different revenue estimates for the same policy?\n",
      "The government and opposition parties use different public institutions to estimate the fiscal impact of their policies.\n",
      "The government’s tobacco excise policy was costed by Treasury, and the revenue estimates published in the 2016-17 Budget. Treasury estimates the policy will raise $28.2 billion over ten years.\n",
      "The ALP’s revenue estimate was prepared by the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO), which costs policies submitted to it by parliamentarians. The PBO estimated the same policy will raise $47.7 billion over the same period.\n",
      "The ALP have not publicly released the full PBO response. However, a PBO response to what appears to be a very similar policy request by Liberal Democratic Party Senator David Leyonhjelm reveals estimates in line with those cited by the ALP.\n",
      "The difference between the PBO’s $47.7 billion estimate and Treasury’s $28.2 billion estimate is $19.5 billion.\n",
      "How can the revenue estimates be so different?\n",
      "Over very long time periods, small differences in assumptions can compound to large differences in revenue estimates over a decade.\n",
      "But even over the four years to 2019-20 – a relatively short period of time – there is a 25% difference between Treasury’s estimate in the Budget papers ($4.7 billion) and the PBO estimate published by Senator Leyonhjelm ($6.3 billion).\n",
      "The chart below shows tobacco excise revenue forecasts for the last two budgets are similar, after subtracting the impact of the new increase to the excise rate from the 2016-17 forecast. So use of different underlying forecasts, absent any policy change, doesn’t seem to be the most likely explanation for the $19.5 billion discrepancy between the PBO’s estimate and Treasury’s estimate.\n",
      "Grattan Institute\n",
      "The most likely source of difference between the revenue estimates is differing assumptions about how increases in tobacco excise will reduce demand for cigarettes. Past increases in tobacco excise rate have clearly reduced tobacco consumption.\n",
      "Grattan Institute\n",
      "As Treasury has noted before, estimating how people will respond to changes in taxes is notoriously difficult, especially in the long term.\n",
      "It’s hard to isolate the impact of tobacco excise on the level of smoking. For example, changes to policy – plain packaging reforms or the many expansions of smoking bans – and to social norms have occurred at the same time as excise increases.\n",
      "Comparing the estimates\n",
      "To see whether differences exist between the behavioural assumptions in the Treasury and PBO costings, we compared the forecast increase in revenue to the planned increase in the excise rate.\n",
      "If there were no change in behaviour, every 10% increase in the excise rate would lead to a 10% increase in revenue. But if people are assumed to smoke less or quit as a result of the increase, a 10% rise in the excise rate will generate a smaller increase in revenue.\n",
      "In the third year after the tobacco excise hikes begin (2019-20), the PBO costing expects each 10% rise in the excise rate to increase excise revenue by 7.8%. By comparison, Treasury expects excise revenue to rise by just 5.6% in that year.\n",
      "So the Treasury estimates clearly assume that the tobacco excise hike will have a larger impact on consumption than has been assumed by the PBO.\n",
      "Shadow Finance Minister Tony Burke told the ABC that:\n",
      "We used the long-held Treasury assumptions that had previously been used. Those were the assumptions determined by the Parliamentary Budget Office and they go through to previous assumptions used by Treasury.\n",
      "However, a similar increase in tobacco excise was costed by Treasury for the former ALP government and published in the previous government’s 2013 Economic Statement.\n",
      "In the third year after the 2013 tobacco excise hikes began, the Treasury expected each 10% rise in the tobacco excise rate to lead to a 5.4% increase in revenue. This suggests the Treasury is using a very similar behaviour change assumption in 2013 to the one it used when costing this year’s budget.\n",
      "Grattan Institute\n",
      "Treasury confirmed at Senate Estimates last Friday that the behavioural assumption used in the 2016-17 Budget costing was a “minor variation” from the 2013 estimate. Treasury’s assumption is based on the range of estimates published by the World Health Organization.\n",
      "Treasury has the final say\n",
      "Treasury is responsible for estimating the budgetary impact of revenue policy changes according to the Charter of Budget Honesty. If elected, an ALP government would have to rely on Treasury’s estimate of the revenue gain from its tobacco excise policy when preparing the budget.\n",
      "Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen has already pledged to accept the Treasury estimates over those produced by the PBO.\n",
      "Labor has played down the impact the discrepancy will have on their spending plans. Asked about the revised figure of $28.2 billion in tobacco tax revenue produced by Treasury modelling, Burke told the ABC that:\n",
      "… if you go through the commitments Labor has so far announced, we were already well south of even that revised figure. We have already more than the improvements to the budget bottom line to pay for everything we have put forward.\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "It is true that there’s a $19.5 billion discrepancy between Labor and Treasury’s revenue estimates. The Parliamentary Budget Office, which costed Labor’s plan, said the tobacco tax hike would rake in $47.7 billion. Treasury estimated the tobacco excise increase would bring in just $28.2 billion. $47.7 billion - $28.2 billion = $19.5 billion.\n",
      "Treasury estimates clearly assume that the tobacco excise hike will have a larger impact on cigarette consumption than has been assumed by the PBO modelling.\n",
      "Even though it has relied on independent costings from the PBO, the ALP now has to accept its tobacco excise policy is predicted to raise nearly $20 billion less revenue over ten years than it had expected. However, Labor has said that it can comfortably budget for the lower Treasury forecasts. – Brendan Coates\n",
      "Review\n",
      "This FactCheck provides a sound overview of tobacco taxation in Australia. It correctly identifies that the likely main difference between the Federal Treasury estimate and the Parliamentary Budget Office estimate of tobacco revenue relates to the assumption made around behavioural change resulting from the increased tobacco excise rates - what economists call the “demand elasticity”.\n",
      "The author makes a fair judgement that the difference between the two costings is likely to mean that Labor will have $20 billion less revenue over the next ten years. – Ben Phillips.\n",

      "On their watch… $100 billion has been added to the national debt. – Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, speech to Queensland Labor Business Breakfast, June 8, 2016.\n",
      "During a speech launching Labor’s economic plan, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said that under the Coalition government, $100 billion has been added to Australia’s national debt.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Checking the source\n",
      "When asked for sources to support Shorten’s statement, a Labor spokesperson told The Conversation that:\n",
      "The 2013 Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook statement showed net government debt at the time of the last election was $184 billion. The 2016 Budget, and Treasury’s independent PEFO which came out three weeks later, showed net debt for 2015-16 will be $285.8 billion – a blowout of more than $100 billion by the Liberals in less than three years.\n",
      "The Budget papers also show that in 2016-17, on the Liberals’ plans, net debt will reach 18.9% of GDP – the highest level since at least 1970 and higher than under any Labor Government in the last 45 years.\n",
      "Is the claim accurate?\n",
      "Shorten’s comment that “$100 billion has been added to the national debt” is\n",
      "correct, but it doesn’t quite tell the whole story.\n",
      "$100 billion as a round number is a fair characterisation of the difference between net government debt in 2013 and in 2016.\n",
      "It’s good that the Labor spokesperson clarified that Shorten was talking about net debt, not gross debt – but that wasn’t immediately clear when Shorten first made the comment.\n",
      "It is net debt, not gross debt, that really matters. Net debt takes account of the fact that foreigners owe us money, too. Just as you count money in your mortgage offset accounting when figuring out how much you “net” owe the bank, so should we do as a nation when looking at government debt.\n",
      "This is particularly important since the Future Fund, Australia’s Sovereign Wealth Fund, is valued at around $117 billion. The fund has been earning strong returns, so this number has grown over the last three years.\n",
      "And it is not net debt in total that is relevant, but net debt as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product. That number has been growing, too.\n",
      "It now stands at 18.3% (shown in the government chart below) up from just over 10% in 2013. However, it is low in comparison to other countries, as the following chart illustrates.\n",
      "Austrade, www.austrade.gov.au\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "Bill Shorten is correct that Australian government net debt has grown by about $100 billion under the Coalition government. But net debt to GDP remains low by international standards. It is getting high by Australian historical standards, which underlines the need to solve the structural budget deficit problem.\n",
      "Review\n",
      "I think that this article provides an accurate check of Shorten’s statement.\n",
      "The statement can be verified from the Pre-Election Fiscal and Economic Outlook papers of 2013 (Table 7) and 2016 (Table 6). The data show that net debt effectively increased from $184 billion before the 2013 election to the current level of $285.8 billion. Further support for the statement comes from the 2016-17 Budget Paper 1, Statement 10, Table 4, which shows that net debt was $153 billion at the time of the last Labor budget.\n",
      "The author is also correct in pointing out that as a proportion of GDP, net debt in Australia is low by international comparison. Data from the April 2016 issue of the World Economic Outlook Database of the International Monetary Fund indicate that out of 27 advanced economies for which data are available, Australia has the sixth lowest level of debt as a proportion of GDP (19.9%, 2016 estimate). To me, this suggests that the approach to fiscal policy should focus on undertaking counter-cyclical measures – meaning reducing spending and raising taxes in boom times, while increasing spending and cutting taxes when the economy slows – rather than reducing debt in itself.\n",

      "In the last calendar year, 300,000 new jobs were created; almost two-thirds of these were women. – Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, speaking to the Menzies Research Centre, June 10, 2016.\n",
      "As part of his pitch to voters about “jobs and growth”, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that 300,000 new jobs had been created in the last calendar year, with women holding almost two-thirds of them.\n",
      "Is he right?\n",
      "Checking the source\n",
      "The Conversation asked the PM’s spokesman for sources to support his statement, but did not receive an on-the-record response before deadline.\n",
      "Nevertheless, it is possible to check his statement against data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Labour Force Survey.\n",
      "Were 300,000 new jobs created in the last calendar year?\n",
      "Yes. ABS trend Labour Force Statistics show an increase of 298,000 in the total number of persons employed between December 2014 and December 2015, as shown in the chart below:\n",
      "Figure 1: Change in the number of people employed (year to date)\n",
      "The job numbers from between December 2014 and December 2015 also show the greatest year to date improvement in employment numbers since the start of Turnbull’s tenure as prime minister (Turnbull became PM in September 2015).\n",
      "Looking at the trend figures from the ABS Labour Force statistics released in June 2016, we see an increase of around 217,000 in the total number of people employed over the year to May 2016.\n",
      "It is true that more jobs are being created, but the rate of growth has been on a steady decline since the start of the year, as the chart above shows. And importantly, the composition of employment is also changing, with a definite shift from full-time to part-time jobs.\n",
      "Are almost two-thirds of the jobs created held by women?\n",
      "Turnbull’s statement that almost two-thirds of jobs created were held by women is correct.\n",
      "Out of the additional 298,000 people employed during the 2015 calendar year, 61% were women, close to the two-thirds claimed by Turnbull.\n",
      "Further, the biggest growth in employment over the year to December 2015 was among women working full-time - a net increase of 111,300, as this chart shows:\n",
      "Figure 2: Change in the number of people employed full and part-time\n",
      "However, if we again take the ABS Labour Force Statistics released in June and look at employment growth in the year to May 2016, we see a different picture.\n",
      "As before, nearly two-thirds of the employment growth across this period has been due to increases in the number of women working both full-time and part-time. But it is no longer full-time work that has seen the greatest increase for women.\n",
      "Part-time employment now plays a greater role, with a net increase of 74,800 in the number of women working part-time. This compares with growth of 66,000 in the number of women in full-time employment.\n",
      "The changes in full-time and part-time employment are even more marked for men. There have been an additional 81,600 men employed part-time over the year to May 2016. At the same time, the number of men employed full-time has decreased by 5,400.\n",
      "Overall, most of the growth in employment over the last 12 months to May 2016 has been driven by growth in part-time jobs for both men and women. In fact, we have seen a fall in the number of men employed full-time in every month since the start of the year. And for women the growth in full-time jobs has disappeared, as this chart shows:\n",
      "Figure 3: Monthly change in number of full and part-time employees, men and women\n",
      "What’s really happening in the Australian labour market?\n",
      "Over the election period, both the Labor and Liberal parties have put forward conflicting views of what’s currently happening in the Australian labour market.\n",
      "The commitment to “jobs and growth” has been one of the most prominent pillars of the Coalition’s election campaign to date.\n",
      "Turnbull has zeroed in on the figure of 300,000, but that figure represents employment growth that occurred in 2015 – and obscures the slower rate of employment growth we’ve seen since the start of 2016.\n",
      "Labor has also been selective in their numbers in putting forward a worse-case scenario picture of the Australian labour market, claiming a large fall in full-time jobs since the start of the year.\n",
      "The real story is more complex and somewhere in between what the two parties are putting forward. Here’s what the numbers show:\n",
      "The number of people employed over the 2015 calendar year rose by about 300,000.\n",
      "The rate of employment growth has eased off considerably since the start of 2016.\n",
      "Nearly three-quarters of recent employment growth stems from part-time jobs.\n",
      "The underemployment rate is the highest it has been in the last 20 years.\n",
      "People are working fewer hours overall since the start of the current year.\n",
      "The decline in aggregate monthly hours has been greater for women than for men over the last three months.\n",
      "Taken together, all of these signals point to a labour market that is weakening.\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "Turnbull’s statement that “In the last calendar year, 300,000 new jobs were created; almost two-thirds of these were women” is correct – but he’s selectively chosen a time frame that shows strong employment growth.\n",
      "He did not use the most recent ABS Labour Force statistics available at the time of his speech (which would have shown a less impressive rate of employment growth).\n",
      "It is also true that nearly two-thirds of the 300,000 jobs created went to women, and most of these were full-time.\n",
      "However, while this is true in relation to 2015, May 2016 ABS labour market statistics show that more of the growth in employment now stems from part-time work.\n",
      "– Rebecca Cassells and Alan Duncan\n",
      "Review\n",
      "This is a sound analysis of Prime Minister Turnbull’s claims about the nature of recent employment growth. The authors rightly point out the differences of interpretation that are possible depending on precisely which time periods are considered. During this election campaign, both major political parties have made radically different claims about the state of the labour market by selectively comparing different data series and time periods. There are dangers in reading too much into any narrow time period; a full understanding requires a longer-term view.\n",
      "The authors could have noted that any increase in employment is only meaningful when expressed relative to other changes. If 300,000 new jobs are created, but 600,000 additional people want to work, then the labour market is not performing well. What matters is the rate of jobs growth relative to population and labour force growth.\n",
      "A key indicator is the employment-to-population ratio, which measures the proportion of the population in employment at any time. The Labour Force Survey data show that the overall employment-to-population ratio has fallen on a trend basis for four of the past five calendar years (2011-2014). It rose steadily through 2015, but fell again in the first five months of 2016.\n",
      "Even in 2015, the full-time share of employment continued to fall. This has mostly affected men, who hold the majority of full-time jobs. As of May 2016, the male trend employment-to-population ratio (66.6%) remains well below its recent peak in early 2008 (69.9%) and also well below its long-term average since 1980 (68.5%). – Joshua Healy\n",

      "On their watch… 50,000 full-time jobs have been lost this year alone. Over one million Australians are underemployed. – Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, speech to Queensland Labor Business Breakfast, June 8, 2016.\n",
      "As he launched Labor’s economic plan in Brisbane, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said that under the Coalition government, 50,000 full-time jobs have been lost this year and over one million Australians are underemployed.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Checking the source\n",
      "When asked for sources to support Shorten’s statement, a Labor spokesperson told The Conversation that the source for 50,000 figure is from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Labour Force data set. That data showed that between December 2015 and April 2016, full-time employment declined by 49,800 (seasonally adjusted).\n",
      "For the statement that “over one million Australians are underemployed”, the spokesman directed The Conversation to Table 22 of the same data set, which showed the number of underemployed persons totalled 1.06 million.\n",
      "You can read the Labor spokesman’s full response here.\n",
      "Have 50,000 full-time jobs have been lost this year alone?\n",
      "As shown by the response above, recent Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) labour force figures do show that there has been a decline in the number of Australians employed full-time since the start of the year. However, the size of the decrease depends on which numbers are selected. And Shorten’s speech selectively zeroed in on a period that showed a big decline.\n",
      "The ABS collect labour force statistics on a monthly basis, but adjustments are made to these estimates to take into account seasonality and previous trends.\n",
      "Many economists would argue that the better figures to use to judge the underlying behaviour of the labour market are trend estimates. These estimates smooth out volatility in the seasonally adjusted estimates and are preferred by the ABS.\n",
      "This chart below shows both the seasonally adjusted and trend estimates data for full-time employees in Australia over the year from April 2015 to April 2016.\n",
      "Number of full-time employees – April 2015 to April 2016\n",
      "Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre, Author provided\n",
      "As you can see above, Shorten was right to say that between December 2015 and April 2016, there was a fall of just under 50,000 full-time employees (using the seasonally adjusted data, shown in red).\n",
      "But looking at the trend estimates, shown in yellow, you can see that there was a smaller decrease of around 12,900 in the number of people employed full-time between December 2015 and April 2016.\n",
      "There is also more to the story than that.\n",
      "Overall, full time employment has risen ‘on the Coalition’s watch’\n",
      "To say that “50,000 full-time jobs have been lost this year alone” may suggest to some that the decline is the continuation of a longer term trend. This wouldn’t be correct.\n",
      "The 50,000 figure is the decrease in full-time employment between December 2015 and April 2016. But if you change the parameters slightly, a different picture emerges.\n",
      "For example, there has been a net increase in full-time employment between April 2015 and April 2016 of around 83,800 using seasonally adjusted figures, or 89,100 using trend estimates.\n",
      "Extend back to September 2013 when the Coalition government came to power, and we see that full-time employment up to April 2016 has increased by 166,700 on seasonally adjusted figures or 200,500 on a trend measure.\n",
      "Number of full-time employees – September 2013 to April 2016\n",
      "Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre, Author provided\n",
      "The change in the number of people employed full-time is a net figure that captures the difference between the number of people moving into full-time employment, and the number leaving full-time employment. And those who leave full-time work may move either into part-time work, unemployment, or withdraw from the labour force altogether.\n",
      "Between December 2015 and April 2016, the number of people employed part-time grew by 75,800 using seasonally adjusted figures, or 47,600 using the trend measure.\n",
      "An alternative labour force indicator that captures the combined effects of changes in the full-time and part-time workforce is the total monthly hours worked in all jobs.\n",
      "This indicator shows both the number of people working and how much they work. We have seen a decline of 14.5 million hours per month since December 2015 on this measure. This represents a fall of just under 1% - albeit after an earlier period of growth.\n",
      "A government’s influence over the labour market is constrained by what is happening in the wider global economy. Taking credit for positive jobs growth or alternatively, laying blame when the labour market pulls back, is valid only to a certain degree. Employment over time can increase because of growth in the economy and the population, rather than through specific government action.\n",
      "Are more than one million Australians underemployed?\n",
      "Shorten’s statement that underemployment currently stands at more than one million Australians is correct. According to ABS trend estimates, the total number of underemployed people is currently 1,063,800, around 58% of whom are women.\n",
      "Underemployment is problematic as it represents lost economic potential, with people currently in part-time employment who would actually like to work more hours but are unable to do so.\n",
      "According to recent research:\n",
      "underemployment is associated with job insecurity, increased casualisation and lower savings, and from a macroeconomic standpoint, underemployment is a signal of inefficiency in the use of skilled labour.\n",
      "Examining the rate of underemployment, which compares the number of people that are underemployed to the total number of people in the labour force, is a useful assessment of the current state of underemployment in Australia.\n",
      "Underemployment rate - 1996 to 2016\n",
      "Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre, Author provided\n",
      "Underemployment is higher now than it has been in the last 20 years, higher even than during the Global Financial Crisis. Underemployment is particularly problematic for women, with more than 10% of women working part-time saying that they would like to work more hours.\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "Shorten’s statement is correct – but he has cherry-picked the data.\n",
      "His claim that 50,000 full-time jobs have been lost this year is correct if one looks at the ABS seasonally adjusted labour force figures between December 2015 and April 2016. But trend estimates are a better data source and they show a lower fall across the same period.\n",
      "Overall, full-time employment “on the Coalition government’s watch” has grown by 166,700 on seasonally adjusted figures or 200,500 on a trend measure.\n",
      "Whichever party is in power, job figures are usually more heavily influenced by global factors than by specific government action.\n",
      "Shorten’s statement that there are over one million Australians underemployed in Australia is correct. The underemployment rate is the highest that it has been in the last 20 years.\n",
      "Review\n",
      "The author has done a good job on this FactCheck and points out the difficulties in comparing monthly Labour Force Survey statistics.\n",
      "The Australian economy creates and destroys hundreds of thousands of jobs every year. The creation and destruction of jobs result from changes in consumer tastes and technological progress. It also results from the successes and failures of entrepreneurs in responding to the opportunities and challenges of shifting consumer tastes and technological change. The volume of job creation and job destruction helps explain why, during most years, the typical person who loses a job is unemployed for a relatively brief period of time.\n",
      "When the Australian Bureau of Statistics announces each month the increases or decreases in the number of persons employed and unemployed, these are net figures. That is, the change in the number of persons employed is equal to the total number of jobs created minus the number of jobs eliminated. In April 2016, the trend estimate of unemployment was 726,600 people or 5.7% of the labour force.\n",
      "The shortcomings of the unemployment rate as an estimate of excess supply of labour are well known to labour economists but not widely understood by the community as a whole – or even among those regarded as informed commentators.\n",
      "For instance, in the Labour Force Survey (from which the unemployment estimates are derived) it is only necessary to have worked for one hour in the survey week to be classified as “employed”. In order to be classified as “unemployed”, respondents must pass a number of tests regarding their readiness for work and their efforts to actively seek work.\n",
      "“Underemployed” means people who are employed part-time but who would like to and are ready to work more hours, including full-time. It also includes those who normally work full-time but at the time of the survey, because of economic circumstances, are working part-time.\n",
      "In April 2016 an estimated 1.063 million people, or 8.4% of the labour force, were underemployed.\n",
      "The sum of the unemployed rate and the underemployed rate is the underutilisation rate, which in April 2016 was 14.2%, or about 1.8 million people.\n",
      "So the extent of the unemployment problem is somewhere between about 700 thousand and 1.8 million people.\n",
      "This might be interpreted as strengthening Bill Shorten’s argument but the degree of labour market underutilisation is not a new phenomenon. It has been of this order of magnitude for decades under governments of both persuasions.\n",
      "A combination of external shocks, globalisation, structural and technical change has significantly changed the nature of demand for labour. Meanwhile, inflexibilities in the labour market have prevented adjustment to these demand changes. The month by month fluctuations in the labour market are of little significance compared to these large scale structural problems in the Australian labour market. – Phil Lewis\n",

      "– The Liberal Party of Australia’s Medium page, June 19, 2016.\n",
      "The Liberal Party has said that it is investing $5 billion more per year on average into Medicare than Labor did.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Checking the source\n",
      "We asked the Liberal Party to provide the sources of the statement but we did not receive a reply before publication. However, we can test this against the available data that tracks Medicare expenditure.\n",
      "The meaning of ‘Medicare’\n",
      "One major uncertainty in the claim is that there are different definitions of what constitutes Medicare.\n",
      "The two major areas we are focusing on as representing Medicare expenditure are the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule (PBS). The MBS covers expenditure on medical services, and includes things like professional attendances, diagnostics and therapeutic procedures, while the PBS pays for drugs. The government budgetary definition of Medicare spending is only for the MBS. However, we believe the PBS is likely to be contained within the Liberal Party figure of $5 billion.\n",
      "One area we are assuming is not included is state spending on public hospitals; if we were to include this, it may increase the difference in total spending between the two periods.\n",
      "Below, the term PBS refers to both the PBS and the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule (RPBS), which provides for certain classes of Department of Veterans' Affairs beneficiaries.\n",
      "Tracking annual spending on the MBS, PBS and RPBS\n",
      "We therefore take the statement by the Liberal Party to mean that the sum of MBS, PBS and RPBS expenditure has increased by an annual average of $5 billion – but note the uncertainty in the definition.\n",
      "The Department of Human Services provides month by month figures on government expenditure for the MBS, PBS and RPBS.\n",
      "Aggregate figures for this are shown below by quarter since January 2008 until the most recent complete quarter (ending March 2016). The transition point between the second Rudd government and the Abbott one is marked approximately on the graph with the vertical blue line.\n",
      "Aggregate PBS/MBS/RPBS expenditure by quarter (2008 Q1-2016 Q1)\n",
      "Author provided\n",
      "Medicare spending under Labor\n",
      "Labor was in power between December 3, 2007, and September 18, 2013. To approximate this period, we used data from January 1, 2008 to September 30, 2013 to represent Medicare expenditure under the Labor government. (We used January 1 rather than the December 1 as some data sources report quarterly data, and January 1 lines up with this.)\n",
      "Over the period of the Labor government, total PBS/RPBS spending was $46.577 billion, and total MBS spending was $93.931 billion. This comes to $140.508 billion, which on an annual basis (based on a figure of 5.75 years to represent the period Labor was in power), is an average spend of $24.436 billion per year.\n",
      "Medicare spending under the Coalition\n",
      "For the period between October 2013 and May 2016 (representing the period when the Coalition has been in power), total spending under the MBS was $54.448 billion, and total PBS/RPBS spending was $26.713 billion.\n",
      "This totals $81.161 billion over two years and eight months, or $30.435 billion per year.\n",
      "So, using our definition of what constitutes Medicare, the difference between the average annual Medicare spend under Labor and the average annual Medicare spend under the Coalition is about $5.999 billion per year.\n",
      "Using these data, the claim made by the Coalition is true.\n",
      "Context matters\n",
      "However, it is not clear whether this increase in spending represents either an increase in spending per person, or an increase in service delivery. All we know so far is that the total dollar amount is bigger.\n",
      "The Australian population has increased between the two time periods, meaning the per capita Medicare expenditure will not have increased at quite the same impressive-sounding rate as the raw figure of an average of $6 billion per year.\n",
      "The second factor to consider is the rising cost of health care.\n",
      "After adjusting for inflation and population growth, the average extra Medicare expenditure will be more modest than that indicated by the raw figures. And health costs are rising faster than inflation.\n",
      "In other words, more Australians than before are accessing Medicare and most unit costs are likely to have, on average, risen.\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "Without knowing the source for the Liberal Party’s claim, it was difficult to know what its “average of $5 billion more per year” claim was based on.\n",
      "Assuming the claim refers to the sum of MBS, PBS and RPBS spending, the Liberal Party is correct.\n",
      "Using our definition of what constitutes Medicare spending, the difference between the average annual Medicare spend under Labor and the average annual Medicare spend under the Coalition is about $6 billion per year.\n",
      "However, care must always be taken drawing conclusions from the raw dollar amounts, since they do not take into account changing population size and inflation. – Richard Norman and Rachael Moorin\n",
      "Review\n",
      "The authors have valiantly attempted to fulfil a tricky brief because of the ambiguity of the claim. It is a sign of Australia’s complex health care system when we can’t even be precise about what constitutes Medicare funding.\n",
      "As noted by the authors, there are different definitions of what constitutes Medicare. Here, the authors have assumed it means spending on the MBS and PBS/RPBS. On this basis they compare average annual MBS/PBS funding during the Gillard/Rudd era with funding during the Abbott/Turnbull era. The authors find that the Liberal Party has underestimated the additional annual spent by around $1 billion.\n",
      "However, if we restrict the claim to Medicare spending only (excluding PBS/RBS spending), the average annual difference between the Abbott/Turnbull and Gillard/Rudd era is $4.13 billion - which implies that the claim is exaggerated by about 21%.\n",
      "Under a broader definition of Australian government health spending, Budget Outcomes data reveals totals of $62.012 billion (2011-12), $61.302 billion (2012-13), $63.983 billion (2013-14) and $65.696 billion (2014-15). Under this definition, and comparing the last two years of the Gillard/Rudd era with the first two years of Abbott era, the increase in annual health funding is substantially less than $5 billion.\n",
      "This brings us to the futility of the claim itself. I agree with the authors that the claim needs be considered in the context of population growth and price increases. After taking these two factors into account, expenditure has increased by a modest amount. While funding health care is an important issue, the claim made by the Liberal Party says nothing about whether the additional funding is delivering greater access to better health care. – Kees Van Gool\n",

      "As the election campaign begins, the Coalition seems intent on making Labor's proposed changes to negative gearing an election issue.At the first leaders debate on May 16, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told an audience of 100 undecided voters that Labor's policy would push up rents.Asked by moderator David Speers how the Prime Minister knew this would happen, he responded:\n",

      "\"If you pull up to a third of the buyers out of the market, the value of property will come down and, if you say to... if you make it harder for investors to buy properties - which, of course, they buy to rent - then there'll be fewer properties to rent, the investors that are left will have to seek a higher return and this is exactly what happened, in the '80s, when Paul Keating banned negative gearing, for a period...\"The claim that rents increased when negative gearing was briefly abolished in the 1980s is one that has been often repeated by those who seek to maintain the status quo.It's similar to a claim made by Joe Hockey in 2015, when he was treasurer, which Fact Check found didn't stack up.It was also repeated by Property Council of Australia CEO Ken Morrison, in another zombie earlier this year.The original claimThe Hawke government briefly abolished negative gearing in 1985, before restoring it again around two years later in 1987.Mr Hockey claimed on ABC's Q&A in 2015 that during that period there was a \"backlash from investors\" who increased rents to replace the lost income that they had been receiving from negative gearing.\"The net result was you saw a surge in rents,\" he said.Fact Check analysed rental data from that period, and found that when negative gearing was abolished only Sydney and Perth experienced strong growth in real rental prices.Rental vacancies in these cities were at extremely low levels at the time, which could explain all or part of the increase.Real rents in Adelaide and Brisbane fell considerably over the period, whilst Melbourne experienced low, or at times no, real growth in rents.An August 1987 cabinet submission from then treasurer Paul Keating said: \"With the notable exception of Sydney, conditions in the residential rental property market are not unusually tight. The evidence suggests that local influences, rather than tax measures, dominate in metropolitan rental markets.Another factor of the era which could have explained increases in rents was high interest rates.\n",
      "Fact check: Did abolishing negative gearing push up rents?\n",
      "Treasurer Joe Hockey says that in the 1980s the Hawke Goverment's decision to scrap negative gearing led to rent increases.\n",
      "A 2013 report from the Housing Industry Association noted that in 1986 and 1987, mortgage interest rates were over 15 per cent, and says \"there is a very strong linkage between interest rates and rental price inflation, with the two variables generally moving in tandem\".The report said that higher interest rates increase mortgage servicing costs, which makes renting more attractive than buying a home. Therefore consumer demand for rental properties increases, which pushes up rents.Ultimately, Fact Check found that if negative gearing were to have a significant effect on real rents, a uniform impact on rents in all capital cities was a likely outcome, which was not what happened when negative gearing was abolished.So, in spite of this undead talking point's refusal to die, it didn't stack up when Mr Hockey made the claim, and it still doesn't today.\n",

      "As Australia heads towards a possible double dissolution election on July 2, Deputy Liberal Leader\n",
      "Julie Bishop has sought to attack Labor's economic record.\"We've never seen such record levels of debt and deficit as were bequeathed to us by the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Government, and Bill Shorten was part of all of that,\" she told Sky News on April 19.It's not the first time Ms Bishop has made this claim.\n",

      "She also made it in early 2015, when she referred to the Abbott government's budget legacy from the previous Labor administration as \"the worst set of financial accounts inherited by any incoming government in Australia's history\".Fact Check found that claim to be wrong, but Ms Bishop has continued to repeat it.At the end of 2015, she even received Fact Check's coveted golden zombie, for the undead claim of the year.The original claimMs Bishop referred to the \"set of financial accounts\" bequeathed to the Coalition in several different interviews at the beginning of 2015, repeatedly framing her claim in terms of debt and deficit.The budget papers show that Mr Abbott inherited a $19 billion annual deficit and accumulated net debt of $153 billion when he took office in September 2013.Fact Check found that whilst these numbers were nominally larger than other budget inheritances, economists said that these actual dollar amounts could not sustain long-term comparisons due to inflation.\"The value of money in different time periods is different and a dollar today may be worth less than a dollar ten or twenty years ago,\" Sydney University economist Michael Rafferty said.\n",
      "Fact check: Did the Government inherit the 'worst set of accounts' in history?\n",
      "Deputy Liberal Leader Julie Bishop says the Abbott Government inherited the worst financial accounts in history.\n",
      "\"If I told you that the average mortgage in 1990 was $200,000, today that figure might be more like $380,000 to $400,000. So nominally, mortgage debt today is nearly double the 1990 figure. But of course incomes have grown in the last 25 years, so if household income has doubled over that time, the amounts are in proportion.\"Experts said the only reliable method was to look at the numbers as a percentage of GDP, rather than dollar amounts.Fact Check considered Ms Bishop's claim in three ways: annual budget deficits in handover years; the accumulation of net debt, the most commonly quoted figure today; and gross debt, the only figure available stretching back to Federation.Kevin Rudd left Mr Abbott a deficit of 1.2 per cent of GDP, net debt of 10 per cent of GDP and gross debt of 16.9 per cent of GDP.Fact Check found that large borrowings to fund Australia's participation in World War I and World War II and the impact of the Great Depression led to much higher deficits and levels of accumulated debt than any government has experienced since. For example, John Curtin's incoming government in 1941 inherited a deficit of 10 per cent of GDP.When it comes to debt, the gross level received by Mr Abbott was vastly smaller than the 71 per cent inherited by Robert Menzies when he took office in 1949 in the aftermath of World War II and the 50 per cent depression-era level handed over by James Scullin to Joseph Lyons in 1932.Even in more recent times, John Howard inherited a worse set of accounts relative to GDP than Mr Abbott.In 1996, Mr Howard was left a deficit of 2.9 per cent of GDP, net debt of 16.8 per cent and gross debt of 21.3 per cent.So despite Ms Bishop's multiple repetitions of the claim, she was, and is still, wrong.\n",

      "Debate over the Government's Senate voting reforms has resulted in a war of words between the Coalition and the Greens, who supported the reforms in the Senate, and Labor and some of the crossbench, who tried to block them.The reforms, which have now passed through both houses, remove group voting tickets and allow voters to preference above the line, and were drafted in response to the result of the 2013 election in the Senate, which saw crossbenchers such as Victoria's Ricky Muir elected on a small proportion of the vote.Opposition frontbencher Anthony Albanese referred to Senator Muir's support in an interview on ABC TV's Lateline on March 18, 2016.\"I tell you what, he got more votes than Michaelia Cash in the Senate, who got to be a minister in the Government,\" he said.Fact Check found that a similar claim, made in a tweet by independent crossbencher John Madigan, was misleading.The original claim\"Cash 'got more votes than Muir',\" Senator Madigan claimed in a tweet on March 1, 2016.Alongside this claim, Fact Check investigated another similar claim from crossbench Senator Glenn Lazarus, who claimed \"Nearly 7000 Qlders voted for me personally. Matt Canavan (NAT), now a minister ONLY got 325 votes. Most crossbenchers received more votes!\" in a tweet on February 26, 2016.Senator Lazarus and Senator Madigan are both referring to the below the line vote for the candidates in 2013, the numbers for which indeed are correct.However, experts contacted by Fact Check found that these below the line votes were largely irrelevant.\n",

      "\"A lot of these claims are technically true in terms of the candidate receiving that many votes below the line, but also totally irrelevant in assessing support for a person being elected for a range of reasons,\" psephologist Dr Kevin Bonham, from the University of Tasmania told Fact Check.Graeme Orr, a professor of law at the University of Queensland told Fact Check: \"Ultimately, under the existing system, no-one is elected because of the '1' personal votes: all are elected by the flow of preferences via party tickets.\"The bottom line was that the overwhelming majority of people (96.5 per cent nationally) voted above the line in 2013, making the crossbench Senators' claims, as well as Mr Albanese's, misleading.\n",

      "In 2015, Australia went to the Paris climate conference with a reduction target of 26 to 28 per cent of its 2005 emissions by 2030.Minister for Resources, Energy and Northern Australia, Josh Frydenberg, characterised this target as \"extremely significant\" in comparison with the rest of the world on ABC TV's Q&A.\"The target we took to Paris which was to reduce our emissions by 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030, saw the second highest target taken to Paris on a per capita basis,\" he said.Fact Check tested a similar claim from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull before the Paris conference in 2015 — that claim was found to be incorrect.The original claim\"When they are measured on a per capita basis, which is the only way they can reasonably be compared with other countries, they are second only to the emission cuts offered by Brazil,\" Mr Turnbull told Parliament on November 23, 2015.Fact Check calculated the per capita emissions reduction targets of Australia, Brazil and several other countries.\n",

      "Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says that Australia's emissions targets of 26 to 28 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030 \"are second only to the emission cuts offered by Brazil\" when measured on a per capita basis.\n",
      "Australia's target means that emissions will be reduced by between 50.5 per cent and 51.9 per cent on 2005 levels per capita by 2030.Brazil's target, calculated as a 53 per cent reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 per capita, stands above Australia, but Switzerland (60.6 per cent) and Norway (56.7 per cent) are both above Brazil.Furthermore, Iceland (52.1 per cent) sits between Australia and Brazil.By these calculations, the emissions targets which Australia took to Paris were at most fifth in the world.Ultimately, Mr Turnbull was, and Mr Frydenberg is, incorrect.\n",

The increase was greater in government schools (1.6%) than non-government schools (1.4%).In January 2016, 30.5 per cent of federal parliamentarians were women. There is a higher proportion of women in the Senate (38 per cent) than in the House of Representatives (27 per cent).The proportion of Australians who were born overseas has hit its highest point in over 120 years, with 28 per cent of Australia's population born outside the country.In 2015, There were 4.3 million Australians with disability — that’s nearly one in five people (18.3% of the total population). After removing the effects of different age structures, the age standardised disability rate for all people was 17.0%.\n",

      "Federal MP for the Queensland seat of Fairfax, Clive Palmer, has used Question Time to push the Government to allow people to access part of their super early, to \"buy a home or support their family in difficult times.\"Mr Palmer claimed that \"A large percentage of Australians will be dead before they are eligible [to use their super].\"Mr Palmer made a similar claim in 2014, which Fact Check found to be wrong.The original claim\"And we know as a statistical fact that over 50 per cent of Australians will be dead by the time they get access to their super,\" Mr Palmer said.Fact Check consulted the Actuaries Institute, which used Australian Life Tables published by the Australian Government Actuary, to calculate that 89 per cent of Australians would live to 65.At this age, Australians are able to fully draw down on their superannuation, even if they are still working.\n",

      "Clive palmer says it is a statistical fact that over 50 per cent of Australians will be dead by the time they get access to their super.\n",
      "But the \"preservation age\" or the age at which people can start accessing their super is even lower, with some people able to start accessing their super at 55, depending on when they were born.This means that the percentage of people who can begin accessing their super before they die would be even higher.Some of Australia's largest super funds confirmed to Fact Check that less than 5 per cent of funds are paid directly to beneficiaries because the member has died.Fact Check determined Mr Palmer's claim to be wrong, and it still is today.\n",

      "The idea of potential changes to negative gearing has re-entered the public debate, after Labor announced its policy to pare back the practice.The Government has not yet made an announcement on any potential plans for negative gearing, but the Property Council of Australia has indicated it is firmly opposed to any changes.\"You know, we saw what happened when the Hawke government changed negative gearing practices back in the 1980s. Well, these changes are far wider than that,\" Property Council of Australia CEO Ken Morrison said.\"At that time we saw rents go up.\"But Fact Check found a that similar claim, made by then-treasurer Joe Hockey in April, 2015, didn't stack up.The original claim\"If you abolish negative gearing on investment properties, there's a strong argument that rents would increase,\" Mr Hockey said on the ABC's Q&A.Mr Hockey said that in the 1980s, when negative gearing was briefly removed, there was a backlash from investors who increased rents to \"replace the lost income\" negative gearing had provided.\"The net result was you saw a surge in rents,\" he said.Negative gearing was abolished in 1985 by the Hawke government, before being restored again around two years later in 1987.\n",
      "Fact check: Did abolishing negative gearing push up rents?\n",
      "Treasurer Joe Hockey says that in the 1980s the Hawke Goverment's decision to scrap negative gearing led to rent increases.\n",
      "Fact Check spoke with economists and analysed rental data from the period in question and found that\n",
      "real rents notably increased only in Sydney and Perth - where rental vacancies were at extremely low levels.This is inconsistent with arguments that negative gearing was a significant factor, with negative gearing likely to have a uniform impact on rents in all capital cities.Fact Check found that at the same time, high interest rates and the share market boom of the mid 1980s increased consumer demand for rental properties, encouraged existing investors to pass on high mortgage costs to renting consumers, and discouraged additional investors from investing in the rental property market.Ultimately, Mr Hockey's claim didn't stack up.\n",

      "He may no longer be prime minister, but that hasn't stopped Tony Abbott's campaign against same-sex marriage.On January 28, 2016, Mr Abbott gave a speech to the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative American Christian organisation which is opposed to same-sex marriage.\"We shouldn't try to change something without understanding it, without grasping why it is that one man and one woman open to children until just a very few years ago has always and everywhere been considered the essence of marriage...\" he said.But ABC Fact Check found a similar claim, made by Mr Abbott in 2013, was incorrect.The original claim\"From time immemorial, in every culture that's been known, marriage or that kind of solemnised relationship has been between a man and a woman,\" Mr Abbott said on October 25, 2013.Fact Check spoke to historians about the history of marriage or marriage-like relationships and found that the concept had not always pertained to unions between a man and a woman in different cultures and periods.\"The most culturally preferred kind of marriage through the ages was between one man and several women – and this is the kind of marriage that is most often referred to in the first five books of the Bible,\" Stephanie Coontz, a professor of history and family studies at Evergreen State College in the US, told Fact Check.\n",
      "Abbott incorrect on the history of marriage\n",
      "Prime Minister Tony Abbott says marriage, or marriage-like relationships, have always been between a man and a woman.\n",
      "\"Polygamy was prevalent throughout the world – and even occurred among the nobility of Christian Europe, requiring a long campaign by the Christian church to wipe it out,\" she said.Journalist and author E.J. Graff of Brandeis University's Women's Studies Research Centre told Fact Check that there were many different examples of different forms of marriage, from many cultures, including \"female husbands\" in Africa, \"male bodied people who identified as women\" marrying men, and even \"a woman and a ghost, though the ghost had originally been of the opposite sex\".Ultimately Fact Check found that a significant body of academic work shows that marriage and \"other solemnised relationships\" have not always been between \"a man and a woman\" and that Mr Abbott was, and is still, incorrect.\n",

      "Between 2014 and 2015, the number of students enrolled in schools in Australia grew by 56,872 (1.5%) to a total of 3,750,973. The increase was greater in government schools (1.6%) than non-government schools (1.4%).In January 2016, 30.5 per cent of federal parliamentarians were women. There is a higher proportion of women in the Senate (38 per cent) than in the House of Representatives (27 per cent).The proportion of Australians who were born overseas has hit its highest point in over 120 years, with 28 per cent of Australia's population born outside the country.In 2015, There were 4.3 million Australians with disability — that’s nearly one in five people (18.3% of the total population). After removing the effects of different age structures, the age standardised disability rate for all people was 17.0%.\n",

      "The Greens will reinvest the $3 billion the government spends each year on its cruel offshore detention centre regime. – The Greens' leader, Senator Richard Di Natale, speaking at the National Press Club, June 23, 2016.\n",
      "Greens leader Richard Di Natale used his National Press Club speech to highlight a key area of policy difference between the Greens and the major parties, describing as “cruel” the offshore asylum seeker detention system supported by the Labor and Liberal parties.\n",
      "Di Natale said the government spends $3 billion each year on the “offshore detention centre regime”.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Checking the source\n",
      "When asked for a source to support Di Natale’s figure of $3 billion, a spokesperson for The Greens readily admitted it was an error. She said Di Natale meant to say offshore detention cost about $3 billion over the forward estimates (the next four years).\n",
      "A good catch by The Conversation. We’ve had a look and that was a genuine error in the speech. It should read “over the forward estimates” not “each year”. We’ll be correcting it online, to reflect our other materials here and here, which have the correct figure.\n",
      "What are the real numbers on the cost of offshore detention each year?\n",
      "How much does offshore detention cost?\n",
      "For every federal budget, each government department produces a portfolio budget statement outlining its costs and spending plans.\n",
      "The Portfolio Budget Statements 2016-17 for the Immigration and Border Protection Portfolio, shown in the table below, put estimated actual spending for offshore management of IMAs (illegal maritime arrivals, which is what the government calls asylum seekers who arrive by boat) at $1.078 billion for the 2015-16 financial year.\n",
      "It is expected to fall to about $880 million in the 2016-17 financial year, the document says.\n",
      "This table shows how much the department intends to spend (on an accrual basis) on some of the programs involved in achieving what it calls Outcome 1.\n",
      "Outcome 1 is defined as:\n",
      "Protect Australia’s sovereignty, security and safety by managing its border, including through managing the stay and departure of all noncitizens.\n",
      "Some of the budgeted expenses for Outcome 1.\n",
      "Department of Immigration and Border Protection Portfolio Budget Statements 2016-17.\n",
      "Please note that the above table is just a portion of budgeted expenses for achieving Outcome 1. You can see the full table on page 27 of the report. Total expenses for Outcome 1 for the year 2015-16 are budgeted to be about $4.15 billion.\n",
      "Adding together the projected cost of offshore detention for the years 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 gets you a figure of about $3 billion for the forward estimates.\n",
      "That is the figure of “$3 billion” Di Natale’s speech referred to, but as his spokesperson points out, he erroneously described it as an annual figure instead of the cost over the forward estimates.\n",
      "So the real annual cost of offshore detention is currently about $1.078 billion.\n",
      "That estimate is supported by this Parliamentary Library document, which shows a figure of around $1.1 billion for offshore management of IMAs.\n",
      "The latest annual report for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection puts the actual spending for offshore management of IMAs at $1.034 billion in 2014-15.\n",
      "Onshore management\n",
      "As outlined in the table above, the department also estimates that for the year 2015-16 it will spend about $1.24 billion on onshore management of asylum seekers who arrive by boat.\n",
      "It’s worth noting that from July 2016 onwards, it will be harder to see at a glance how much the government spends on onshore management of asylum seekers. That’s due to budget restructuring, meaning there will no longer be a separate budget item called “onshore management of IMAs”. As the figure below shows, that funding will now be reported, together with some other costs, under the broader “Program 1.3 Onshore Compliance and Detention”.\n",
      "How the Immigration and Border Protection Portfolio will report slightly differently in the 2016-2017 budget, compared to 2015-2016.\n",
      "Portfolio Budget Statements 2016-17, Budget Related Paper No. 1.11 Immigration and Border Protection Portfolio, page 25, CC BY\n",
      "You can read more about that change on pages 24-25 of the Portfolio Budget Statement.\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "As his spokesperson readily admitted, Richard Di Natale was wrong to say that the government spends $3 billion each year on the offshore detention centre scheme. The figure is closer to $1.078 billion for the year 2015-16.\n",
      "Spending on offshore management of boat arrivals is estimated to be close to $3 billion over the forward estimates. – Fabrizio Carmignani\n",
      "Review\n",
      "This is a sound analysis of the budget for processing and management of asylum seekers and refugees in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. It is important to note that the government is also spending large amounts of money on other operations falling within Operation Sovereign Borders such as disruption of people smuggling operations, border patrols, interceptions and boat turnbacks.\n",
      "Australia also contributes to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which has said it is struggling to cover the cost of assisting high numbers of displaced people. – Mary Anne Kenny.\n",
      "*Correction and Editor’s note: This article was corrected on July 1 to replace the figure of “$880,509” for offshore detention of IMAs for 2016-17 with the real figure of “$880 million”. We also corrected the figure of offshore cost of offshore management of IMAs in 2014-15 from “$1.034” to at “$1.034 billion”. The Conversation apologises for these editing errors and thanks reader Glenn Wilson for alerting us to them. The verdict remains unchanged. This story was updated on June 30 at 1:20pm to add additional information about how onshore management costs will be reported differently in the federal budget from July 2016 onwards (the section beginning with “It’s worth noting…”).\n",

      "Might I remind you that when we closed down the live animal export industry, it was around about the same time that we started seeing a lot of people arriving in boats in Australia. – Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, speaking at the Regional Leaders' Debate in Goulburn, May 25, 2016.\n",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce caused a ripple when he linked asylum-seeker arrivals to Australian shores with the previous government’s decision to ban live cattle exports over animal welfare concerns.\n",
      "The day after the debate, Joyce sought to clarify his comments, saying:\n",
      "What I’ve said is quite clear. That basically we already had 14,000 people that had come in through boats. Another 40,000 came in afterwards. But you don’t fix the problem of people coming in illegally by creating another problem, which was banning live cattle trade.\n",
      "Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has quashed any suggestion of a connection between the two issues, saying:\n",
      "Let me be quite clear about this: there is no link between the Indonesian government and people smuggling.\n",
      "In any case, it is beyond the scope of FactCheck to say whether diplomatic problems between Indonesia and Australia led to an increase in boat arrivals. The factors driving migration are multifaceted and complex.\n",
      "But what does the data say about the number of boat arrivals before and after the live export ban?\n",
      "What happened after the 2011 live export suspension?\n",
      "The previous Labor government announced a suspension of live animal exports to certain facilities in Indonesia on May 31, 2011, after an ABC Four Corners program about animal cruelty to Australian cattle exported to Indonesia.\n",
      "In early June, 2011, the government suspended all live cattle exports to Indonesia.\n",
      "The suspension was lifted around a month later in early July 2011 after new conditions were written into export permits.\n",
      "The Conversation asked Joyce’s office for a source to support his assertion that more asylum seekers arrived “around about the same time” as the June 2011 ban on live animal exports to Indonesia. A spokesperson referred to Australian Parliamentary Library figures for calendar-year boat arrivals between 2009 and 2013:\n",
      "Parliamentary Library figures on boat arrivals between 2009 and 2011.\n",
      "Parliamentary library\n",
      "The numbers of people arriving by boat were fairly steady over the late 2000s, with the numbers increasing toward the end of 2011.\n",
      "Parliamentary Library\n",
      "In a submission to a Senate committee, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said that between December 2007 and June 2011 (around the time the live export ban was introduced) about 11,500 asylum seekers arrived by boat.\n",
      "The data show there wasn’t an immediate marked increase in arrivals after June 2011 (around the time of the live export suspension). The ban lasted little over a month and the number of arrivals remained relatively flat over that period.\n",
      "The number of arrivals did increase markedly toward the last quarter of 2011, and dropped again in early 2012 during the monsoon season. The numbers increased in 2012 and 2013.\n",
      "Did 14,000 people arrive by boat before mid-2011 and 40,000 after the live export ban?\n",
      "Joyce didn’t specify what time period he was referring to when he contrasted the pre-live-export-ban arrival numbers with the post-ban figures.\n",
      "Government statistics show that:\n",
      "From the financial years July 2007 to June 2011, 11,607 people arrived by boat, including 565 crew (Rudd came to power in December 2007).\n",
      "From financial years July 2011 to June 2013, an additional 33,769 people arrived by boat, including 613 crew. The peak was during the financial year 2012-2013 when just over 25,000 people arrived by boat.\n",
      "From July 2013 to the end of August 2013, 5,736 people (excluding crew) arrived by boat.\n",
      "It is possible Joyce calculated the pre-ban figure of 14,000 by adding up arrivals from the calendar years 2007 to 2011. However, this methodology would include boat arrivals from the second half of 2011 (after the ban).\n",
      "It is an exaggeration to say that 14,000 people came prior to the banning of live cattle exports in May 2011. The figure is closer to 11,500, if you count arrivals from when Rudd took power in 2007 to June 2011 (when the live export ban was announced).\n",
      "It is roughly correct to say 40,000 asylum seekers arrived by boat between July 2011 and September 2013. However, the significant increase in numbers came in the latter part of 2012.\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "There was no immediate increase in the number of people arriving by boat “about the same time” as the cessation in live cattle exports. The ban lasted little over a month and the number of arrivals remained relatively flat over that period. An increased number of arrivals did commence toward the end of that year.\n",
      "It is an exaggeration to say that 14,000 people came prior to the banning of live cattle exports in May 2011. The figure is closer to 11,500, if you count arrivals from late 2007 to June 2011 (when the live export ban was announced).\n",
      "Joyce’s figure of 40,000 arrivals is roughly correct, if you count from July 2011 to September 2013. However, the most significant increase in arrivals occurred in the second part of 2012 – not immediately after June 2011.\n",

In relation to Joyce’s comments, it is important to emphasise that although about 40,000 asylum seekers arrived between July 2011 and September 2013, the numbers were consistently below 500 from June to October 2011. The number of boat arrivals reached over 1000 for the first time in December 2011, and the most significant spike in numbers occurred from April 2012 to September 2013 – well after the live export ban was lifted. – Alex Reilly\n",

      "Currently religious organisations receive tax-exempt status because advancing religion is presumed to be of public benefit within the Charities Act 2013… Religious organisations are also exempt from standard accounting and record-keeping obligations. – Australian Sex Party website, June 2016.\n",
      "The Australian Sex Party is fielding candidates for seats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate in the 2016 federal election. Under one of the policy headings on its website, “Religious Tax Exemption”, it says religious organisations receive tax-exempt status due to the public benefit presumed to be derived from the advancement of religion, and that religious organisations are exempt from standard accounting and record-keeping obligations.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Checking the source\n",
      "We asked the Australian Sex Party for the source of its statements but it did not get back to us before publication. But it is possible to test the statements against current Australian legislation.\n",
      "Are religious organisations tax-exempt?\n",
      "Yes. Religious organisations have always been tax-exempt in Australia. This includes large bodies such as the Anglican and Catholic Churches, through to smaller ones such as the Church of Scientology, Seventh Day Adventist Church, and the Exclusive Bretheren.\n",
      "This is explicit under the Charities Act 2013. It defines a charity as “a not‑for‑profit entity” – which can’t be an individual, a political party or a government entity – with one of the following 12 “charitable purposes”:\n",
      "a)\n",

      "d)\n",
      "advancing religion;\n",
      "e)\n",
      "advancing culture;\n",

      "preventing or relieving the suffering of animals;\n",
      "j)\n",
      "advancing the natural environment;\n",
      "k)\n",
      "any other purpose beneficial to the general public that may reasonably be regarded as analogous to, or within the spirit of, any of the purposes mentioned in paragraphs a) to j);\n",
      "(l)\n",
      "the purpose of promoting or opposing a change to any matter established by law, policy or practice in the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or another country…\n",
      "But it’s slightly more complicated when it comes to how some religious bodies have to report their finances.\n",
      "What are “basic religious organisations”? And how much do they have to report?\n",
      "A basic religious organisation is a special sub-group of charities, for instance individual parishes, that exist for the purpose of advancing religion.\n",
      "Until a few years ago, there was no statutory financial requirement for any charity to publicly report on its finances. But in 2012, the then Labor government established a national regulator of charities, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC).\n",
      "The ACNC has brought accountability and transparency to the non-for-profit sector. Since then, a reporting regime has been phased in but some smaller charities – notably basic religious organisations – remain exempt from financial reporting obligations.\n",
      "“Basic” religious charities do not have to answer financial information questions in annual information statements given to the ACNC, or submit annual financial reports to ACNC (regardless of its size), or comply with the ACNC governance standards.\n",
      "Basic religious charities are the only type of charity to receive this level of exemption from reporting obligations. That is why small churches, such as local parishes, are exempt.\n",
      "However, if the religious charity runs a school or accepts government grants or runs other fee-for-service operations then it is required to report. This is because it is capable of being registered for more than one charitable purpose and is thus not a basic charitable organisation.\n",
      "The ACNC has been the subject of debate by religious organisations.\n",
      "The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, in its submission (number 76) on a 2014 bill that was intended to repeal the ACNC’s enabling legislation, proposed changes to the way regulation occurs, saying that:\n",
      "The ACBC respectfully proposes to the Committee that this Inquiry should focus more on the nature of regulation and less on the identity of the agency. The current regulatory regime has meant additional reporting and red tape especially in view of the duplication with state and territory legislation. Unincorporated entities now have new reporting obligations which are particularly burdensome for those that are heavily dependent on volunteers. If allowed to continue these higher compliance costs will inevitably have a detrimental effect on the delivery of services without any material benefit.\n",
      "A separate submission (number 58) by Catholic Health Australia argued in favour of the bill aimed at repealing the ACNC’s enabling legislation.\n",
      "However, in March 2016, after extensive consultation, the government announced it would retain the ACNC.\n",
      "Reporting by charities\n",
      "Even when charities report their data, what is provided is often inconsistent. The ACNC acknowledges this in a section on its website under the subheading Presentation of financial reports:\n",
      "All charities have to prepare their financial reports in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and present a true and fair view. However, the way one charity presents information in a financial report may be different from how another charity presents its information. As long as it is a true and fair view this is acceptable.\n",
      "Charity finance staff and their advisers use their professional judgement to decide how accounts are treated and financial reports are prepared. For example, a charity may provide a detailed breakdown of expenses (such as ‘stationary expenses’) whereas another charity may include smaller items (such as stationary) as part of ‘other expenses’. The way charities allocate and classify costs can also vary quite significantly. For example, some charities may focus on program allocation of costs but other charities may group costs according to their nature (such as ‘employee expenses’, ‘administration’ and so on).\n",
      "To date the reporting of financial statements remains inconsistent in presentation. A 2014 study found “a lack of comparability and inconsistencies in financial reporting disclosures relating to fundraising revenues and expenses” among Australian non-profits. Despite Australian accounting standards providing an overall framework for the preparation of annual financial statements, the study’s analysis of 13 award-winning annual reports from charities revealed a wide variation in terms:\n",
      "Eleven [reports] had 34 different terms or combinations of terms to describe fundraising income and expenses, as well as other issues which thwarted any attempt at meaningful comparison.\n",
      "But without the ACNC we would know nothing at all about happenings in the sector. Some data is better than no data. Each year since 2012, reporting is becoming more robust and standardised.\n",
      "In any case, there is now a standard charter of accounts. The vast majority of charities submit financial reports and provide a reporting framework in the form of a standard charter of accounts. Because of the ACNC the public can now view financial information for 2014 from almost 23,000 Australian charities. We have even had a better picture of the number, types and activities of Australian not-for-profits.\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "The Australian Sex Party is correct on both claims. Religious organisations do receive tax-exempt status. And “basic” religious organisations do remain exempt from standard accounting and record-keeping obligations.\n",
      "However, many Australians wouldn’t know what a “basic” religious organisation is, so that’s important to clarify. Large faith-based organisations, such as Anglicare or Catholic schools, are not considered “basic religious charities”; it’s more likely to be a small church or local parish. And what’s also not clear from the Australian Sex Party’s website is that public reporting in this sector has improved greatly since 2012, when a national charities regulator was set up.\n",
      "The Party’s argument that religious charities are not entitled to tax exemptions because advancing religion is not a charitable cause is a subjective position, rather than a statement that can be fact checked.\n",
      "– Bronwen Dalton\n",
      "Review\n",
      "I agree with the author’s verdict on the Australian Sex Party’s claims.\n",
      "It is true that a not-for-profit entity that has the purpose of “advancing religion” falls within the definition of charity in the Charities Act. This was also the case before the introduction of the Act. In fact, such organisations have been tax exempt since the introduction of income tax in 1915. The courts take a broad view of “religion”, so it is not just the large, well-known religions that benefit, but also smaller or more marginal religious entities.\n",
      "The presumption of public benefit is also of long standing but the Charities Act does indicate that the presumption can be rebutted by evidence to the contrary, so presumably evidence of harmful practices might indicate the entity is not entitled to be registered as a charity (and so not entitled to tax concessions).\n",
      "In relation to basic religious entities it is also worth noting that entities with income of less than $250,000 per annum do not have to provide detailed financial information to the ACNC and many parishes etc would also be covered by these tiered reporting requirements.\n",
      "Finally, I would note that the ACNC has released a report based on data collected from the first couple of years of reporting requirements and this provides very useful analysis of the charitable sector generally. I agree with the author that the information gathered by the ACNC is a valuable resource and the greater transparency is also of benefit to the sector, as it will increase public confidence in it.\n",
      "– Ann O'Connell\n",
      "CORRECTION: This article was corrected on June 25, 2016 to more accurately reflect the content of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference submission to a Senate committee considering repeal of the ACNC’s enabling legislation. The verdict of the FactCheck remains unchanged.\n",
